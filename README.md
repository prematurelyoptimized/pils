Pure Integer Linear Solver

## Overview
This is a toy project to build a pure integer linear programming solver using only integer arithmetic.  The underlying algorithm is the revised lexicographic dual simplex algorithm.

Because this is an academic exercise, it's not fast, it doesn't support all problems (like unbounded ones), but it's not that complicated and it is exact.  If you find it useful, leave a note or an enhancement request (or even better, a PR).
